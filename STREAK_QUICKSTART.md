## How to Maintain Streak

### Each Day, Complete All 4 Goals:

1. **💧 Water**: Drink 4L
2. **🍎 Calories**: Hit 2,300 kcal (±10%)
3. **💪 Exercise**: Log 60+ min
4. **⚖️ Weight**: Enter today's weight

### Result:
- ✅ All 4 = 🟢 Green circle = Streak continues
- ⚠️ 2-3 = 🟡 Yellow circle = Streak breaks
- ❌ 0-1 = ⚫ Gray circle = Streak breaks

## Daily Workflow

```
Morning (8 AM)
├─ Step on scale → log weight ✅ (1/4)
└─ Drink first liter of water

Mid-Morning (10 AM)
└─ Log water intake so far ✅ (2/4 if 4L reached)

Lunch (12 PM)
└─ Log meal calories

Afternoon (3 PM)
└─ Complete workout → log minutes ✅ (3/4)

Evening (7 PM)
├─ Log dinner
└─ Check calorie total ✅ (4/4 if target hit)

Before Bed (10 PM)
└─ Check Streak tab → See green circle! 🟢
```

## Tips for Success

### Week 1: Build the Habit
- Set phone alarms for each goal
- Morning alarm: Weigh yourself
- Afternoon alarm: Exercise time
- Evening alarm: Check progress

### Week 2: Optimize
- Front-load water (2L by lunch)
- Pre-plan meals for calorie accuracy
- Schedule exercise at same time daily
- Weigh in first thing every morning

### Week 3+: Autopilot
- Habits now feel natural
- Less thinking required
- Streak becomes motivating
- Don't break the chain!

## Recovery Plan (If Streak Breaks)

1. **Don't Panic** - Everyone breaks streaks
2. **Identify Why** - Which goal was hardest?
3. **Adjust Strategy** - Make it easier
4. **Start Immediately** - Begin new streak today
5. **Beat Your Record** - Aim for longest + 1

## The Psychology

### Why It Works:
- **Visual Feedback**: See your progress
- **Gamification**: Makes fitness fun
- **Loss Aversion**: Don't want to break chain
- **Identity Shift**: "I'm a consistent person"

### Don't Break the Chain:

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My streak shows 0 but I did everything yesterday?**
A: Check if ALL 4 goals were met. Streaks require 100% completion.

**Q: What counts as completing the calorie goal?**
A: Within ±10% of target (2,070 - 2,530 kcal for 2,300 target)

**Q: Do I need to log weight if it didn't change?**
A: Yes! Daily weigh-ins maintain accountability and streak.

**Q: Can I change my goals?**
A: Goals are based on your profile. Update in Weight tab settings.

**Q: What if I'm sick/traveling?**
A: Health first! Streaks can be rebuilt. Focus on recovery.
